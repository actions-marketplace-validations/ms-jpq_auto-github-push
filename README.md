# Auto Github Push

This Docker image will automatically push a file called `.agp` under `.github/` for every public repo you own.

This will refresh various Github inactivity countdowns.

## How to use

0) Create an empty repo

1) Create a token with repo access.



## Disable for single repo

Add `.noagp` under `.github/`
